However, as genomic data increases with the decreasing cost of sequencing, metadata related to animal health and disease can be used to supplement GBADs' existing data. There are estimates that predict that there are up to 40 billion gigabytes of genomic data generated every year and that over the next decade genomics research will generate between 2 and 40 exabytes of data (Stephens et al. 2015). The National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) is an example of a set of databases that holds information pertinent to GBADs. As more researchers are conducting genomic work on livestock and other economically important species, data on breed, location, and individual condition and disease are being recorded. In particular, NCBI's BioSamples database stores the accompanying metadata to genetic sequences uploaded to NCBI. As sequencing becomes more cost efficient, animal metadata that can be used by GBADs will accumulate. There has been a remarkable spike in the number of metadata entries concerning livestock in the past 7 years (Figure 1). These metadata accompany genomic studies carried out by not just universities, but also organizations around the world. NCBI has already been used to create databases for other researchers to use (Hu et al. 2022). The AnimalMetagenome DB (",(0,i.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"http://animalmetagenome.com"},"http://animalmetagenome.com"),") holds metagenomic data for 4 domestic species and an abundance of wild species.

In order to standardize basic animal health data across countries, location and breed data are incredibly important. Classifying the global range of animals will assist in understanding the spread of diseases originating from animals. Users can input location data as a basic attribute in the BioSamples database. In particular, entries can contain the location of the submitter, sampling location, and even specific sampling coordinates. These data can reflect where certain species densely populate or which countries and locations have a lack of data. Although DNA sequencing has decreased in cost, it is still a sizable purchase; therefore, these data can also indicate whether there are inherent biases in the presence of genomic sampling across countries. Using rentrez, an R package to access NCBI (Winter 2017), we were able to extract metadata entries for genomic studies involving livestock and other economically important species. Figure 2 illustrates the geographic spread of these data, where it is shown that there are clusters of data in highly studied areas. Conversely, there are clear gaps in data across Africa and parts of Asia (Figure 2).

By 'viable', we mean information that is disease related, as many entries had random characters or non-related information. The remaining 2 percent of data held diseases and disease agents that overlapped with WOAH's disease agent list (WOAH, personal communication of internal document).

The figure below illustrates this variation, where cattle, chicken, and pigs returned the most amount of data.
