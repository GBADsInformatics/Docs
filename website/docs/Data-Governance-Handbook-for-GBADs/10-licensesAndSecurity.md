# Data Licenses, Security, and Privacy

There are 3 core instances where data licensing, privacy, and security are important: 

1. Ensuring that we use, store, and share data according to the licensing agreement, and that we are citing data properly 
2. Securely storing private data to protect PII 
3. Attributing a license any output data created by GBADs 

Ensuring that the processes involved in the security and access of data in GBADs fosters a community of trust with data contributors and users. 

---

**Note on Private Data:**

We are currently only using public data for models in GBADs. In anticipation for private data we have conceptualized and created the infrastructure that will support the security of private data.

---

**Working Group 1 should be aware of licensing and privacy when creating partnerships and alliances with potential data contributors.** 

## Data 'Openness' On a Spectrum

GBADs disseminates and in some cases stores data that has various access, usage and reuse restrictions. Not all data can be open, and data privacy isn't as simple as having either open or private data. In order to encourage sharing, it is important that data contributors are given the option to select how they would like their data to be used, what they want it to be used for and who they would like it to be used by. Data licensing agreements make sure that data usage isn't confused, and inform our system on who can see, download or use data. 

```{margin}
**Even data that is defined as "Open" needs a license!** When you use Open data you still need to determine how to properly attribute (or cite) the data set. In addition, data can be considered Open but may still have restrictions on what it can be used for. For example, some Open data licenses restrict the use of data for commercial purposes. 
```

The [Open Data Institute](https://theodi.org/about-the-odi/) communicates this idea by putting data on a spectrum from closed to open data.

## Categories on the data spectrum

We used the spectrum to come up with four discrete data licensing categories:

**Open data**: “Open means anyone can freely access, use, modify, and share for any purpose (subject, at most, to requirements that preserve provenance and openness).”
 
**Public access data**: The data is protected by a licensing agreement that limits the use and dissemination of the data and/or the models the data can be used for. This could include the way the data can be used and for what purposes, attribution requirements etc.

**Group-based access data**: Authentication is required to access the data. Like public access data, the data is also protected by a licensing agreement that limits the use and dissemination of the data and/or the models the data can be used for. 

**Named access data and internal access data**: A special contract will be required to articulate the use, attribution and access restrictions of the data. This will be explicitly assigned by a contract and/or NDA, which will require direct contact with the GBADs legal team. We grouped these two, because both will need a data contract and require named (and authenticated)access to use.

---

**Decisions Needed:** 

* How will users be authenticated? 
* How will groups of users be authenticated? 
* What license will we use for models generated by GBADs and data outputs generated by the models?

### Personal Identifiable Information (PII)

Personal Identifiable Information (PII) is any information that can be used to identify a person, residence or farm. This could include names, email addresses, geolocation or vet records for example. No matter the type of PII, data containing should be managed carefully. 

PII should be protected and secure, with restricted access requirements. Depending on the use case, the data may be able to transformed to protect the PII. For example, geolocations can move up in spatial granularity and data can be provided in regions or zones or by country. Email addresses, phone numbers and names of farms can be encrypted on ingest and removed from data tables. 

---

Secure Data Storage Infrastructure 

As the GBADs Knowledge Engine is a cloud service, any data that includes PII will be stored in a secure bucket, such as the [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) bucket.

---

## Licensing

Licenses inform who can access data, how data can be used, who it can be used by and for what purposes and how to properly attribute the data. 

### License uses 
Licenses have 3 utilities for GBADs, each which are informed by the CARE principles: 

1. Protect Data Contributors 
**Any time data is contributed to GBADs, data holders will be required to select a license for their data.** 

This is a CARE sharing mechanism because licenses enable data contributors to have the Authority to Control their data throughout it's lifecycle and with licenses that dictate the usage restrictions of the data, the data can be used for the Collective Benefit of the data holder individually, or the group that the data holder represents. 

Publicly available licenses will be linked to in the metadata, and the citation/attribution information will be disseminated alongside the dataset.

2. Inform Data Users
Each data set will be licensed and the licensing and citation information will be available in the data set's metadata. Therefore, data users will be informed of how they can use the data that they access and the attribution that they must use. 

3. Inform System View
Open and public data will be available to any user who enters the site, but group or named access data will need authentification, and therefore will be inaccessible by default. 

In other words, the view of GBADs Knowledge Engine will be informed by the licensing agreement. In some cases, this may mean that even the metadata will not be shown to unauthorized users. In other cases, the descriptive metadata may be available and users could request access. What the public, or certain users and groups can see will be governed by the choices of the data user. 

### License selection

Data holders contributing Open or public access data must chose a licensing agreement for their data. There is a suite of data licensing agreements that data holders can choose from. These include: 

* Creative Commons Licenses. The [Creative Commons license selector tool](https://creativecommons.org/choose/) allows individuals to select the features of usage, adaptation and sharing, and provides a license that reflects these preferences.
* [Open Data Commons Licenses](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/) including the [Open Data Commons Open Database License (ODbl)](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/), the [Open Data Commons Attribution License](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/by/) and the [Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License (PDDL)](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/). 

### Future Directions 

In some cases, private data agreements will have to be made with a legal team to ensure that the usage restrictions, security, and licensing information are properly agreed upon between the data holder and GBADs.

<!-- Machine Readable Licenses
GBADs is exploring how to make licenses machine readable, so that data that flows through the knowledge engine and is stored in GBADs repositories can be more FAIR. In addition, we use data privacy restrictions to inform system views for different users to help protect the usage requirements set forward by data contributors.  -->

<!-- 
```{admonition} Decision Needed
GBADs must determine whether data contributors can change the license on their data after they submit it and if so how to communicate to individuals who may have downloaded the data in question. In addition, GBADs must decide how the retraction of data affects pre-existing models.
```

Data Types
GBADs is a trusted broker for 

the following data types: indigenous, academic, non-corporate (e.g. NGO’s), 
corporate, and commercial data (Table 1). Through collaborations with community outreach programs and 
other organizations, GBADs may also serve as the sole repository of particular data. Data can fall into 
multiple categories (for example, data can be corporate and commercial).  We can also classify the data 
as open (accessible to everyone) or private (accessible only to a defined set of users). The definitions 
of each data type provides a basis for understanding the ownership, access and licensing specifications 
of the data handled by GBADs and its users. 

Data and user types are being further refined as they will be used to determine the view of the data portal 
interface.  For example, a controlled vocabulary is required to properly define Indigenous data.  In the 
Canadian context, marking data simply as ‘Indigenous data’ is not adequate to properly define the provenance 
and governance of these data assets. There are many types of Indigenous peoples in Canada (Metìs, First Nations, 
etc.), each from different areas of the country and with different traditions and customs. Therefore, in order 
for the data to be of collective benefit, data must be properly labelled to which type of Indigenous data it 
is related to. 

Similarly, for small stakeholders there may be ontological needs that are not yet anticipated, especially when 
considering each stakeholder from the global perspective. If we wish to be a ‘trusted’ data broker for small 
stakeholders, private, and marginalized groups, it is important that we work with our data contributors, especially 
those without power, to annotate our data such that it is for the Collective Benefit of small stakeholders 
(and not just large). --->

<!---Table 1: Data types definitions

| Data Type | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Indigenous data | All data owned by Indigenous Peoples and their territories including but not limited to data related to cultural heritage, knowledge, natural resources, practices and languages. This includes data that are “collected by governments and institutions about Indigenous Peoples and their territories” (GIDA, 2019). |
|Academic data | Data that are owned or collected by individuals belonging to academic institutions such as Universities.  This includes data available through academic journal articles and data collected through experimental procedures for research. |
| GBADs Data Repositories | Data that is collected through collaborations with GBADs such partnerships with communities, researchers, academic institutions and NGOs. Note that data housed by GBADs may fall under other categories (i.e. data that are housed by GBADs may also be academic data), but GBADs will govern the licensing and degree of availability and openness of this data. |
| Commercial data | Data from commercial organizations, usually but not limited to a paid accrual method. |
| Corporate data | Data obtained from a corporate company, organization or group. This includes government and UN sourced data, such as the World Bank and FAO. |
| Non-corporate data | Data from non-corporate entities, organizations or individuals. |
```{note} Data can be commercial and corporate, or non-commercial.

Licensing


To ensure that data are FAIR(S) and CARE, the licensing information for each data source will be accessible to users in the 
metadata. Licensing information must be accessible to ensure that users can assess the reusability of the data and comply 
with potential data use restrictions and attribution requirements. Clear and accessible information about data use restrictions 
are especially important for compliance of CARE principles; in specific, to protect Indigenous Data Sovereignty and to lift the 
rights and interests of all GBADs Indigenous data contributors (CARE:A1;A2;A3). 

```{admonition} Decision Needed
GBADs needs to establish whether it intends to have a preferred license for all data housed in its data repositories and whether 
this license should be one that ensures that data cannot be used for commercial purposes.
```
 
The metadata for each data source must include a URL to the licensing agreement of the data and any related metadata (if applicable). 
 
A list of common data licensing agreements has been collected and are available in Appendix F: Common Licensing Agreements. In 
some cases, such as for data coming from non-corporate sources, licensing information may not have been determined or decided 
on. Data contributors will be provided with our list of preferred data licensing agreements or encouraged to select a license 
using the [Creative Commons License Selector Tool](https://creativecommons.org/choose/). 
 
To ensure that data are used for the collective benefit of Indigenous Peoples, Indigenous data contributors may choose to govern 
who has access to their data (CARE:A2). The GBADs data portal will be designed to accommodate this distinction and to ensure the 
security and privacy of parties involved.  
 
Handling Open and Private Data
------------------------------

The GBADs data portal is a data broker, meaning we handle and provide data contributed by other sources. Therefore, it is not 
at the discretion of GBADs to determine who can access data that is not housed by GBADs. To ensure that the rights of data 
contributors are respected, the data portal and informatics website will ensure that the data are secure and can only be accessed 
by the individuals identified by the data contributors/owners. 

As suggested by FAIR:A2, metadata for all data sources (open and private) will be available through a metadata search portal and 
will remain accessible even in the case where data is no longer available through the GBADs portal. However, not all of the data 
corresponding to metadata will be available to all users. Because provenance information is included in the metadata, this will 
allow data users to track archived data sources to their original owner. 

GBADs anticipates the following user types: 
- Academic users
- Corporate users 
- Non-corporate users 
- Commercial users 

Open (meta)data will be publicly accessible to all users of GBADs. See Mechanisms for Data Sharing for more information about 
how the GBADs system will handle different user types and data restrictions, while keeping privacy and security a priority for the system. --->
