# Introduction 

The [Global Burden of Animal Diseases (GBADs)](https://animalhealthmetrics.org/) is a data-driven programme that aims to minimize the economic and health burden of animal diseases through the creation of models and estimates that inspire policy-making in the livestock agriculture sector. 

GBADs analytical procedures, such as models and estimates, are being designed so that they can be replicated on different case studies and countries. In other words, the same procedures should be able to be used with different data. Similarly, pre-existing calculations and estimates should be able to be reused. Therefore, models, input data, and data produced from models or estimates must be well-documented, standardized, and catalogued to allow these resources to be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR Principles [^1]) in the Knowledge Engine. 

<mark>The Data Governance Handbook outlines the procedures, standards, and best practices that we are employing to facilitate the reproducibility and replicability of analytical processes and to promote the FAIRness of data, parameters, and models.</mark>

## Why Data Governance? 

We need data governance: 

* to be able to find data, parameters, and models that are used or created by GBADs' collaborators, and understand how each of these components relate. 
* to be able to reproduce models and estimates because we know each component that was used in each, where to locate them, and how they were used to create outputs
* to be able to understand how outputs and estimates were created and where the data, models, and parameters come from
* to be able to build on each others' work 
* to know how to design and build technology that serves a purpose for users, adheres to standards, and provides transparency in our work flows 
* to be able to build and deliver quality data products 
* to know who to contact when we have a question about a model

## Defining Data Governance for the Global Burden of Animal Diseases 

>>>
"Data governance is everything you do to ensure data is secure, private, accurate, available, and usable. It includes the actions people must take, the processes they must follow, and the technology that supports them throughout the data life cycle. [^2]" 
>>>

As elucidated by the quote above, data governance encompasses the use and management of data as a program including the technological requirements for data to be stored, accessed, and found responsibly, and the processes that themes must follow to ensure that all data is usable, accessible, accurate, secure, and when applicable private.

This is a "living document"! As the GBADs Informatics theme learns more about the data governance and the GBADs data needs, we will update and adjust this book accordingly.
