# Data Governance Operating Model

A data governance operating model is a an operating model that defines an organization's key data processes, the roles and tasks involved in each of those processes, and the people, tools, and technology that are required to fulfill each of the processes.

**In this section:** 

* We outline the data goals for GBADs
* We outline the key data processes for GBADs based on the data flows
* We outline the data governance operating model for GBADs using the GBADs' governance structure (Working Groups) to understand the roles and responsibilities for each of the tasks involved to fulfill the data goals

## Goals

The main data goals for GBADs can be broken down into the following: 

1. Identification of data sources 
    * Identify data sources that are needed for GBADs modelling purposes
    * Where necessary, create data alliances with private and public data holders 
2. Improve accessibility to data 
    * Improve accessibility to identified data sources by creating channel of access for data sources of interest. This may include scraping documents or webpages, reformatting and storing downloaded data, or creating tools that can operate with Application Programming Interfaces of interest. 
3. Quality and semantics 
4. Reduce replication of data sources and data cleaning 
5. Modelling procedures are reproducible
6. Data is discoverable (a.k.a. Findable) to data users
7. Trace data lineage to ensure that all data procedures are replicable, to ensure that data is not replicated, to help with data quality and updates, and to keep track of which versions of data are used in publications
8. Dashboards are deployed on GBADs servers 

<!-- 
From FAIR to FAIRS
    Data that can be used in a timely manner for decision making.
    Data that have been analyzed for quality, and these metrics are available as part of the meta-data.
    As complete a data collection as possible for all its stakeholders. This will include data that GBADs redirects from other organizations and data that GBADs stores for associated projects and partners.
    Data that are relevant to the modelling, decision support, and other purposes important to the aims of GBADs and its users.
    Data that are easily accessible to appropriate users (both machine and human).
    Data that are interpretableâ€”the semantics to be encoded in meta-data and other semantic systems.
    Access to technology and products that are innovative and advance the state-of-the-art.
    A system that allows for the customization of information through mechanisms and processing that adjusts the granularity of the data to the user's needs. -->


<!-- * Assess the quality of all input data according to quality metrics established by the Informatics team and communicate the quality via data quality reports or dashboards 
* Data can be shared with internal and external partners via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and/or files in S3 buckets 
* Reduce data replication and provide processes so same versions of data can be used by all data users in GBADs 
* Trace data lineage and provenance to ensure that changes to data and outputs are reproducible and traceable, and to ensure that 
* Ensure that modelling procedures are well documented,
* Provide infrastructure to 

The goals were drafted using the 2023 Investment Document.  -->

## People and Processes

The governance structure of GBADs is split into three main Working Groups, each with unique, but overlapping responsibilities: 
* Working Group 1 (WG1) - Data alliances, Communication of information and Adoption and uptake
* Working Group 2 (WG2) - Methods and Analytics
    * WG2 subgroup farm-level 
    * WG3 subgroup societal burden
* Working Group 3 (WG3) - Informatics
