Specifically, this relies on the ability to categorize users and create system views for that user where that user can only see the data that they are authorized to. We use the term \u201cview\u201d as described by database theory: \u201cViews are generally used to focus, simplify, and customize the perception each user has of the database. Views can be used as security mechanisms by letting users access data through the view, without granting the users permissions to directly access the underlying base tables of the view\u201d. In other words, allowing data contributors to select which type of users they would like to allow to access their data creates a \u201cview\u201d for that data user (either hides or makes available specific data assets).

However, the mechanisms behind user verification are still under stipulation (we are still trying to figure out how we verify the identity of users from marginalized groups, private stakeholders etc).
