Metadata can be thought of your data 'user guide' - it should tell you everything you need to know to determine whether the data is suitable for your analysis, and how the data came to be. Sometimes, we find ourselves in situations where we come across some data and have no idea where the data originated, the experimental methods that were used for data collection, or which models created the data. Even more troubling, is when units of measure aren't provided or column headers are ambiguous. Metadata is the solution to this problem. So, when you input your data into the GBADs system, or provide API information from another source, we will ask you to fill out a form that will autogenerate metadata so that you (and others) can reuse the data and create accurate insights, models and data driven decisions.
